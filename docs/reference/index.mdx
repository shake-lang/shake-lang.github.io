# Shake Programming Language Features

## 1 Introduction

Shake is a high level, object-oriented, multi-targeting, modern programming
language. It can be compiled into different languages (targets), such as `C`,
`C++`, `C#`, `Java`, `JavaScript` and binary executables as well as interpreted
(currently the only implemented target is `JavaScript`).
It also provides a scripting language for faster and more efficient creation
of small projects.

### 1.2 Overview

The following code is an example for a simple program written in Shake.

```shake
fun main() {
  println("Hello World!")

  val i: int = 10;
  val j: int = 5;
  val k: int = i + j;
  println(k);
}
```

This code will print "Hello World!" to the console, then calculate the sum
of the two integers `i=10` and `j=5` and print the result (15) also to the
console.

## 2 Primitive Datatypes

There are 8 primitive datatypes in Shake:

| Type             | # of Bytes | Range                                            | Description                       |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| byte (int8)      | 1          | Whole numbers from -2^7 to 2^ - 1                | Signed 8-bit integer              |
| short (int16)    | 2          | Whole numbers from -2^15 to 2^15 - 1             | Signed 16-bit integer             |
| int (int32)      | 4          | Whole numbers from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1             | Signed 32-bit integer             |
| long (int64)     | 8          | Whole numbers from -2^63 to 2^63 - 1             | Signed 64-bit integer             |
| float (float32)  | 4          | Floating point numbers from ±3.402823e38         | 32-bit floating point number      |
| double (float64) | 8          | Floating point numbers from ±1.7976931348623e308 | 64-bit floating point number      |
| boolean          | 1 [*]      | Either `true` or `false`                         | Boolean, either `true` or `false` |
| char             | 2          | Unicode characters                               | 16-bit Unicode character          |

_\* A boolean behaves like 1 bit, but it occupies 8 bits (one byte) in RAM_

additionally there is one unsigned variant of each integer type.

| Type   | # of Bytes | Range                           | Description             |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ubyte  | 1          | Whole numbers from 0 - 2^8 - 1  | Unsigned 8-bit integer  |
| ushort | 2          | Whole numbers from 0 - 2^16 - 1 | Unsigned 16-bit integer |
| uint   | 4          | Whole numbers from 0 - 2^32 - 1 | Unsigned 32-bit integer |
| ulong  | 8          | Whole numbers from 0 - 2^64 - 1 | Unsigned 64-bit integer |

## 3 Operators

### 3.1 Mathematical Operators

_Shake has 6 different types of mathematical operators_

```shake
10 + 3   // plus (=13)
10 – 3   // minus (=7)
10 * 3   // multiply (=30)
10 / 3   // divide (=3)
10 % 3   // modulo (=1)
10 ** 3  // power (>> 10 * 10 * 10) (=1000)
```

### 3.2 Comparison Operators

_These are Shake's comparison-operators_

```shake
9 == 8  // equals (false)
9 != 8  // not equals (true)
9 >= 8  // bigger Equals (true)
9 <= 8  // lower Equals (false)
9 > 8   // bigger (true)
9 < 8   // lower (false)
```

### 3.3 Logical Operators

```shake
true || false  // or (at least one of them has to be correct)
true && false  // and (both of them have to be correct)
true ^^ false   // xor (either one, but not both have to be correct)
```

_NOTE: All binary operators will work on booleans as well. Via operator overloading they do exactly the same as logical operators on booleans, so true ^ false will work the same as true ^^ false. It is better practice to use the logical operators though!_

### 3.4 Bitwise operators

#### 3.4.1 Understanding binary numbers

_You can skip this paragraph if you understand the basic concept of binary numbers
which is necessary for sections `3.4.2` and `3.4.3`_

Binary operators can manipulate individual bits of values.
To understand binary operations, you first have to understand binary numbers.
In binary numbers, each digit is represented as either 0 or 1. You can write each number
as base 2, which is very similar to decimal numbers (base 10), but with only 2 instead of 10 (0 through 9) possible characters per digit. Since some humans previously decided to use 0 and 1 as these two numbers, we would count like this:

```text
0 (0), 1 (1), 10 (2), 11 (3), 100 (4), 101 (5), 110 (6), 111 (7)... (and so on)
```

for a negative number you can use the same principle, but start with a minus sign.

to convert a binary number to decimal you can use the following formula:

```text
decimal = binary * 2^0 + binary * 2^1 + ... + binary * 2^n
```

and to convert a decimal number to binary you can use the following formula:

```text
binary = decimal / 2^0 + decimal / 2^1 + ... + decimal / 2^n
```

This is how most primitive datatypes work. They just have a differing number of bits.

These data types also have to be able to store negative values. So the first digit is used to store the sign.
So for negative numbers the first digit is 1 and the rest of the digits are 0.
The formula to convert a binary number to decimal is the same as positive numbers, but we calculate (-1) + `[positive amount]` because we don't need a negative zero.

Now that we know how to convert numbers to binary and back we can start to understand the different operators.

#### 3.4.2 Bitwise and, or, xor

```shake
0b1010 & 0b0101  // 0b0000 Binary AND
0b1010 | 0b0101  // 0b1101 Binary OR
0b1010 ^ 0b0101  // 0b1011 Binary XOR
```

If we just think about the bits as boolean values, we can use the AND, OR and XOR operators to manipulate the bits.
so bit 1 from the first number is ANDed with bit 1 from the second number, bit 2 from the first number is ANDed with bit 2 from the second number and so on.

#### 3.4.3 Bitwise shift

```shake
0b1010 << 1  // 0b1010 Binary left shift
0b1010 >> 1  // 0b0101 Binary right shift
0b1010 >>> 1 // 0b0101 Binary right shift (unsigned)
```

Using `lshift` and `rshift` we can shift the bits of a number to the left or right by a certain amount.

#### 3.4.4 Bitwise not

```shake
~0b1010  // 0b0101 Binary NOT
```

The NOT operator inverts all bits of a number.

Note: The `not` operator targets all bits, so the byte `0b0001` is actually `0b00000001` and the `not` operator will therefore return `0b11111110`.

### 3.5 Brackets & Priorities

#### 3.5.1 Brackets

As the standard math rules still apply, Shake first performs all multiplications (and divisions) in the term and then any additions or subtractions.
Hence, to multiply the sum of some numbers, brackets have to be placed around the numbers to be added up before they are then multiplied, eg.

```shake
4 * 10 + 3    // >> 43
4 * (10 + 3)  // >> 52
```

_(Hint: Brackets can be placed inside other brackets, inner brackets are always calculated first)_

As seen above, Shake "prioritizes" certain operations over others. For a complete overview of these priorities, take a look at the list below.

#### 3.5.2 Priorities

1. [brackets](#3.5.1-Brackets)
2. [bitwise and, or, xor](#3.4.2-Bitwise-and-or-xor) `&`, `|`, `^`
3. [bitwise shift](#3.4.3-Bitwise-shift) `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`
4. [mathematical](#3.1-Mathematical-Operators) \> power `**`
5. [mathematical](#3.1-Mathematical-Operators) \> multiply, divide, modulo `*` `/` `%`
6. [mathematical](#3.1-Mathematical-Operators) \> plus, minus `+` `-`
7. [logical operators](#3.3-Logical-Operators) \> and `&&`
8. [logical operators](#3.3-Logical-Operators) \> or `||`
9. [comparison](#3.2-Comparison-Operators) \> equals, not equals `==` `!=`

## 4 Variables, Values and Constants

### 4.1 Variables

Variables are used to store data, which can be changed during the execution of the program.
In Shake, variables are declared using the `var` keyword, followed by the name of the variable,
a colon and the type of the variable.

A variable that is declared outside a function's body is called a field.

```shake
val i: int = 10;  // i is a variable of type int and is assigned the value 10
```

### 4.2 Values

Values are used to store data, which cannot be changed after it has been assigned.
In Shake, values are declared using the `val` keyword, followed by the name of the value,
a colon and the type of the value.

```shake
val PI: float = 3.14159;  // PI is a constant of type float and is assigned the value 3.14159
```

### 4.3 Constants

Constants are used to store data, which cannot be changed during the execution of the program.
A const binds even stronger than a val, the content of a const must also be constant and known at compile time.

```shake
const val PI: float = 3.14159;  // PI is a const of type float and is assigned the value 3.14159
```

### 4.4 Type Inference

Shake has a feature called type inference, which allows the programmer to omit the type of a variable or constant, if it can be inferred from the value.

```shake
val i = 10;  // i is a variable of type int and is assigned the value 10
val PI = 3.14159;  // PI is a constant of type float and is assigned the value 3.14159
```

## 5 Control Structures

### 5.1 If-Else

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

```shake
if (condition) {
  // code block
} else {
  // code block
}
```

### 5.2 While

The `while` statement is used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

```shake
while (condition) {
  // code block
}
```

### 5.3 Do-While

The `do-while` statement is used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
The block of code is executed at least once, even if the condition is false.

```shake
do {
  // code block
} while (condition);
```

### 5.4 For

The `for` statement is an enhanced version of the `while` statement.
It can be used to execute a block of code a specific number of times.
It consists of three parts: the initialization, the condition and the increment.
The initialization is executed once at the beginning of the loop. The condition
is checked before each iteration of the loop. The increment is executed at the end
of each iteration of the loop.

_NOTE: The increment is even evaluated if the remaining code
block is skipped using `continue`._

```shake
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // code block
}
```

### 5.5 Break

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop, switch or block of code.

```shake
while (true) {
  if (condition) {
    break;
  }

  // some code that will not be executed if the condition is true
}
```

### 5.6 Continue

The `continue` statement is used to skip the remaining code block of a loop and continue with the next iteration.

```shake
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    continue;
  }

  // will only print odd numbers
  println(i);
}
```

### Return

The `return` statement is used to exit a function and return a value.

```shake
return "Hello World!";
```

For functions that do not return a value, the `return` statement can be omitted.

```shake
fun functionName() {
  // code block
}
```

Return with no value is equivalent to `return` can be used to exit a function early.

```shake
fun functionName() {
  if (condition) {
    return;
  }

  // code block
}
```

## 6 Functions

### 6.1 Function Declaration

A function is a block of code that can be called from other parts of the program.

```shake
fun functionName() {
  // code block
}
```

### 6.2 Function Return

A function can return a value using the `return` statement.

```shake
fun functionName(): int {
  return 10;
}
```

_Note: If a function does not return a value, the return type is `void`._

```shake
fun functionName() {
  // code block
}
```

is equivalent to

```shake
fun functionName(): void {
  // code block
}
```

### 6.3 Function Parameters

A function can have parameters, which are used to pass data to the function.

```shake
fun functionName(param1: int, param2: int) {
  // code block
}
```

#### Default Parameters

A function can have default parameters, which are used if no value is passed for the parameter.

```shake
fun functionName(param1: int = 10, param2: int = 20) {
  // code block
}
```

Such a function can be called with no parameters, one parameter or both parameters.

```shake
functionName();  // param1 = 10, param2 = 20
functionName(5);  // param1 = 5, param2 = 20
functionName(5, 15);  // param1 = 5, param2 = 15
```

You can also select which parameter you want to set by using the parameter name.

```shake
functionName(param2=15);  // param1 = 10, param2 = 15
```

### 6.4 Function Overloading

Shake supports function overloading, which allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.

```shake
fun functionName(param1: int) {
  // code block
}

fun functionName(param1: char) {
  // code block
}
```

### 6.5 Function Recursion

A function can call itself, which is called recursion.

```shake
fun factorial(n: int): int {
  if (n == 0) {
    return 1;
  }

  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

## 7 Classes

### 7.1 Class Declaration

A class is a blueprint for creating objects.

```shake
class ClassName {
  // class content
}
```

### 7.2 Class Constructor

A class can have a constructor, which is used to initialize the object.

```shake
class ClassName {
  constructor() {
    // code block
  }
}
```

#### Overloading Constructors

A class can have multiple constructors, which is called constructor overloading.

```shake
class ClassName {
  constructor() {
    // code block
  }

  constructor(param1: int) {
    // code block
  }
}
```

On construction, the constructor with the most matching parameters will be called.

#### Named Constructors

There may be cases, you want to have multiple constructors with the same parameters.
In this case, you can use named constructors.

```shake
class ClassName {
  constructor create() {
    // code block
  }

  constructor other() {
    // code block
  }
}
```

### 7.3 Class Properties

A class can have properties, which are used to store data.

```shake
class ClassName {
  val property: int = 10;
}
```

Properties can be accessed using the dot operator.

```shake
val obj = new ClassName();
println(obj.property);
```

### 7.4 Class Methods

A class can have methods, which are used to perform actions.

```shake
class ClassName {
  fun methodName() {
    // code block
  }
}
```

Methods can be called using the dot operator.

```shake
val obj = new ClassName();
obj.methodName();
```

### 7.5 Class Inheritance

A class can inherit from another class, which is called inheritance.

```shake
class ParentClass {
  // class content
}

class ChildClass : ParentClass {
  // class content
}
```

Classes defaulty inherit from the `Object` class, which provides some basic methods like `toString` and `equals`.

A class can only inherit from one class, so called `superclass`, but a class can implement multiple `interfaces`.

A class can also implement one or more interfaces.

```shake
interface InterfaceName {
  // interface content
}

interface OtherInterface {
  // interface content
}

class ClassName : InterfaceName, OtherInterface {
  // class content
}
```

### 7.6 Class Abstract

A class can be declared as abstract, which means it cannot be instantiated.

```shake
abstract class ClassName {
  // class content

  fun methodName() {
    // code block
  }

  // abstract method which should be implemented by subclasses
  abstract fun abstractMethod();
}
```

### 7.7 Class Static

A class can have static properties and methods, which are used to store data and perform actions without creating an object.

```shake
class ClassName {
  static val property: int = 10;

  static fun methodName() {
    // code block
  }
}
```

Static properties and methods can be accessed using the class name.

```shake
println(ClassName.property);
ClassName.methodName();
```

## 8 Interfaces

### 8.1 Interface Declaration

interface is a contract that defines the signature of the functionality. It is a blueprint of a class.

```shake
interface InterfaceName {
  // interface content
}
```

### 8.2 Interface Methods

An interface can have methods, which are used to perform actions.

```shake
interface InterfaceName {
  fun methodName();
}
```

A interface is abstract by definition, so all methods are abstract by default.

### 8.3 Default Methods

An interface can have default methods, which are used to provide a default implementation.

```shake
interface InterfaceName {
  fun methodName() {
    // default implementation
  }
}
```

### 8.4 Static Methods

An interface can have properties and methods, which are used to store data and perform actions without
creating an object.

```shake
interface InterfaceName {
  static val property: int = 10;

  static fun methodName() {
    // code block
  }
}
```

Static properties and methods can be accessed using the interface name.

```shake
println(InterfaceName.property);
InterfaceName.methodName();
```

### 8.5 Inheritance

An interface can inherit from another interface, which is called inheritance.

```shake
interface ParentInterface {
  // interface content
}

interface ChildInterface : ParentInterface {
  // interface content
}
```

An interface can inherit from multiple interfaces.

```shake
interface InterfaceName : ParentInterface, OtherInterface {
  // interface content
}
```

### 8.6 Implementation

A class can implement one or more interfaces.

```shake
class ClassName : InterfaceName, OtherInterface {
  // class content
}
```
