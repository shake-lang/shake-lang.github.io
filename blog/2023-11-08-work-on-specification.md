Hey, we're working on the specification now. We're trying to make it as detailed as possible,
so that everyone can understand it. We're also trying to make it as easy as possible to understand.

Take a look at [ðŸ”— shakelang.github.io/specification](https://shakelang.github.io/specification)
(Its very work in progress, so don't expect too much)
